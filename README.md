# JECRC Custom Token Project

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a custom token using blockchain technology on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The token is developed using **Solidity** in the **Remix IDE** and deployed through **MetaMask**. The token represents a digital asset with real value that can be used for decentralized transactions, ensuring transparency, security, and trust.

## Features
- **Custom Token Development**: Creation of a JECRC token using the BEP-20 standard on the Binance Smart Chain.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Written and deployed using Solidity on Remix IDE.
- **Integration with MetaMask**: Wallet setup and integration with decentralized apps (DApps) for transactions.
- **Decentralized Transactions**: Conduct token transactions on the blockchain with transparency and immutability.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **IDE**: Remix IDE
- **Wallet**: MetaMask for token transactions
- **Testing**: JavaScript for deployment and testing scripts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Armaan-sinwar-1233/Blockchain-Token-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Blockchain-Token-Project
    ```

3. Install MetaMask as a browser extension, if not already installed.

4. Open the `contract.sol` file in **Remix IDE** and deploy the token on the **Binance Smart Chain**.

## Usage

1. **Smart Contract**: Use Remix IDE to compile and deploy the token smart contract (`contract.sol`).
2. **Token Deployment**: Once deployed, the contract can mint and transfer tokens.
3. **MetaMask**: Connect the deployed contract to MetaMask for managing and interacting with tokens.
4. **Transactions**: Use MetaMask to send tokens to other users or integrate with decentralized applications (DApps).

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of the token deployment and transaction process:

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced token functionalities such as staking and rewards.
- Explore cross-chain token deployment for broader use cases.
- Build a web-based interface for users to interact with the token.
